   - Inside `loadCategories()`:
     - Fetch category data from API.
     - For each category in the response:
       - Create an `<option>` element.
       - Set its value and text content to the category name.
       - Append the option to the category dropdown (`categorySelect`).

3. Search by User Input
   - When the user presses "Enter" in the search input:
     - Call `searchRecipes()` function.
   - Inside `searchRecipes()`:
     - Get the user input value.
     - Return early if the input is empty.
     - Show the loading indicator.
     - Clear any existing search results.
     - Fetch recipe data from API using the input as a query parameter.
     - If successful, call `displayResults()` with the returned meals.
     - Handle errors and hide the loading indicator afterward.

4. Search by Category
   - When a category is selected and search triggered:
     - Call `searchByCategory()` function.
   - Inside `searchByCategory()`:
     - Get the selected category from the dropdown.
     - Show loading indicator and clear results.
     - Fetch meals from the API based on the selected category.
     - Pass the meals to `displayResults()` or show an error if fetching fails.
     - Hide the loading indicator at the end.

5. Display Results
   - `displayResults(meals)`:
     - Check if meals array is empty. If yes, show "No recipes found" message.
     - For each meal:
       - Create a card with meal name and image.
       - Add a "View Recipe" button that calls `showRecipeDetails(mealId)`.

6. Show Recipe Details in Modal
