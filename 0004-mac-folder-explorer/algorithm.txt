Algorithm for Generating a Folder Structure in JavaScript

1. Define the folder structure as an array of objects, where each object represents a folder.
   - Each folder object contains a "name" property.
   - Some folders have a "subfolders" property, which is an array of subfolder objects.

2. Create a function "createFolderList(folders)" that generates an unordered list ("ul") of folders:
   - Initialize an empty "ul" element.
   - Iterate over each folder object in the provided "folders" array.
     - Create a "li" element for the folder.
     - Set its inner text to the folder's "name".
     - Add a CSS class "folder" to the "li".
     - Append the "li" to the "ul".
     - If the folder has "subfolders", recursively call "createFolderList" with "subfolders" as input.
       - The returned "ul" is initially hidden ("display: none").
       - Append this "ul" as a child of the current "li".
       - Add a click event listener to the "li" that toggles the visibility of the subfolder "ul".

3. Call "createFolderList(folderStructure)" with the predefined folder structure to generate the list.

4. Append the generated folder list to the HTML element with the ID "folderStructure".
