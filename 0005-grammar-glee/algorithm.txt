Algorithm for Grammar Quiz Navigation and Scoring System

1. **Initialization**
   - Set "totalQ" to 10, representing the total number of questions.
   - Retrieve elements for navigation buttons ("prevButton" and "nextButton").
   - Retrieve all questions ("ques") and convert them into an array ("quesArr").
   - Initialize "qIndex" to 0, ensuring the first question is displayed while others are hidden.
   - Retrieve all progress indicators ("progress") and convert them into an array ("progArr").
   - Set the background color of the first progress indicator to active while others remain inactive.

2. **Previous Button Click Event**
   - Check if "qIndex" is greater than 0.
   - Hide the current question and decrement "qIndex".
   - Display the previous question.
   - Update progress indicators: Set background color to active for completed questions and reset for upcoming ones.
   - Ensure the submit button is hidden if not on the last question.

3. **Next Button Click Event**
   - Check if "qIndex" is less than the total number of questions.
   - Hide the current question and increment "qIndex".
   - Display the next question.
   - Update progress indicators based on the new "qIndex".
   - If the last question is reached, display the submit button.

4. **Submit Button Click Event**
   - Initialize "score" to 0.
   - Loop through each question (from 1 to "totalQ").
   - Retrieve the selected answer for each question.
   - If the selected answer is correct (value is "true"), increment the "score".
   - Call "displayScore" function to show the result.

5. **Display Score Function**
   - Hide all questions, the navigation button container, and the progress bar.
   - Display the result container showing the final score.
   - Reveal the restart button.
