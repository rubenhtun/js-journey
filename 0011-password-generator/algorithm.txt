Algorithm: Password Generator and Copier

1. Initialize Variables
   - Select DOM elements: password display, generate button, copy button, checkboxes for character types, password length input, and success message container.
   - Define character sets: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols.

2. Generate Password on Button Click
   - When the user clicks the Generate button:
     1. Start with an empty string `chars` to collect allowed characters.
     2. Check which character-type checkboxes are selected:
        - If "Include Lowercase" is checked, append lowercase letters to `chars`.
        - If "Include Uppercase" is checked, append uppercase letters to `chars`.
        - If "Include Numbers" is checked, append number characters to `chars`.
        - If "Include Symbols" is checked, append special characters to `chars`.
     3. Retrieve the desired password length from the input field.
     4. Initialize an empty password string `psw`.
     5. Loop through the range of the desired length:
        - Generate a random index based on `chars.length`.
        - Append the character at that index to `psw`.
     6. Display the generated password in the password input field.

3. Copy Password to Clipboard
   - When the user clicks the Copy button:
     1. Check if a password is present in the input field.
     2. If present, use `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` to copy the password.
     3. Show a temporary success message for 2 seconds.
     4. After 2 seconds, hide the success message again.
